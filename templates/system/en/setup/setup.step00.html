										The Loxberry extends your Loxone Smarthome by many interesting and useful features, which can not provided by the Loxone-System itself. These features
										are realized using Plugins, which can be installed later on.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Basic System of the Loxberry is free of charge and is maintained by volunteers in their leisure time. The Source Code is free and is distributed
										under the Apache 2.0-License. The Loxberry arose from an idea in the Loxone-Forum (<a href="https://www.loxforum.com/" target="_blank">https://www.loxforum.com/</a>).
