      <p>
      The Loxberry extends your Loxone Smarthome by many interesting and useful features, which can not provided by the Loxone-System itself. These features
      are realized using Plugins, which can be installed later on. So you can install only the Plugins you want.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Basic System of the Loxberry is free of charge and is maintained by volunteers in their leisure time. The Source Code is free and is distributed
      under the Apache 2.0-License. The Loxberry arose from an idea in the Loxone-Forum (<a href="https://www.loxforum.com/" target="_blank">https://www.loxforum.com/</a>).
      If you are looking for help or like to improve your Loxberry skills take a look into the Loxone Forum. It's a good port of call. All Loxberry Developers are 
      active there and can probably help you.

      In the following Setup-Wizard the basic System Setting like Networking or Time Server are done.
      The Loxberry will not work without these mandatory settings. All further Plugins (Features) can be installed and configured later from the Main Menu.

      <p>
      An additionally hint: At any time the Info-Button in the upper right corner of your screen gives you a short help about the current configuration page.
      There is also a Link to a more detailed Help Page where the features are described step by step. Don't hesitate to use the help!
