INTRO_HEADER="About USB Storage"
INTRO_TEXT1="This widget shows connected USB storage devices. It has no options, as LoxBerry automatically mounts these devices. In the overview, you can check the device names, size and file system type. The overview automatically checks if the device is readable, or read-only."
DEBUGLOG_HEADER="Create Debuglog"
DEBUGLOG_TEXT1="If LoxBerry cannot detect your device, or you have problems accessing the device, press the <i>Create Debuglog</i> button. LoxBerry will dump system information about the USB devices to a logfile. Check this logfile, or submit the result in loxforum.com in the LoxBerry section."
