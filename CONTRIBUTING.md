# Contributing to LoxBerry

Thanks for taking time to read our contribution tips! :tada::+1:

We currently work on LoxBerry Version 0.3 that will be a major step from 0.2x, as we got lot of feedback from users and developers, and found several issues that restrict plugin developers.
Also we will do some moderate changes to the user interface and experience.

The current development branch is *loxberry-0.3.0-saruman*, not master. Therefore, if you do any Pull requests, please request your pull for loxberry-0.3 instead to master.
We do not merge any code to the master anymore, as 0.23 is stable since a while.

To get a good basis to start surfing code, test and develop, you should install the DEV-Image of LB 0.3.x. You'll find the images on https://download.loxberry.de/testing/images/rasppi/. Take the lastest 0.3.x saruman and install it to your RaspBerry.

It is a good idea to browse the issues - also issues already closed (remove the is:open filter) to see where the journey goes.

We "excessively" use labels in issues. 
The 'bug' label needs to be fixed definitely.
The 'enhancement' is a user story that we try to catch, but if it has ...
... 'must have' we will do it for 0.3.x.

Some of our issues we additionally have labels with 'good first issue'. We thing this are parts that new developers could achieve also without knowing the entire system.

If you have any questions, give us a message on Github or inside an issue. 
If you speak German, our disussion base is an own area in LoxForum: https://www.loxforum.com/forum/projektforen/loxberry/entwickler

Thank you and we are awaiting your first pull request! :)
